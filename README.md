This project was completed for The Odin Project Javascript Library Assignment.
The aim of the project was to make a game of Tic-Tac-Toe by using the concepts of Modules in JS, Public and Private Scopes, using them to expose API for your application and Factory Functions.  
It also has an implemented Ai using MiniMax algorith, more about which can be read [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/?ref=lbp).

# TO-DO
<ul>  
  <li><strong>COMPLETE THEMING SUPPORT</strong>, as it stands the theming options do nothing. Adding multiple theme options will require a major code refactor which is why I have currently pushed the task to a later date.</li>
  <li>Make website more Mobile friendly.</li>
  <li>Implement Alpha-Beta pruning.</li>
</ul>
